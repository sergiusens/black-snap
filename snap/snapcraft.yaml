summary: The uncompromising Python code formatter
description: |
  Black is the uncompromising Python code formatter. By using it, you
  agree to cede control over minutiae of hand-formatting. In return,
  Black gives you speed, determinism, and freedom from pycodestyle
  nagging about formatting. You will save time and mental energy for
  more important matters.
  Blackened code looks the same regardless of the project you're
  reading. Formatting becomes transparent after a while and you can focus
  on the content instead.
  Black makes code review faster by producing the smallest diffs possible.
